# Terraform-modules-GCP

Here I have tried creating Terraform Modules for GCP resources. 

At the top, I have created one modules folder consisting of main.tf, outputs.tf and variables.tf and then there is this another folder called as setup and it consists of a file again
named as main.tf using which we will export our module and will be used by different users. 

Rest is simple terraform scripts in all the .tf files.
